# Seven phylogeny trees saved in GrapeTree json format, as Supplementary Files for Li et al.
## Something before you try to use these data
* File with '.json' subfix was generated by GrapeTree[^GrapeTree], which included a newick format phylogeny and a built-in metadata table.
* If you are an expert of EnteroBase or GrapeTree already, just try visulization on your PC directly; If not, please follow the following documentary or refer to the [GrapeTree tutorial](https://enterobase.readthedocs.io/en/latest/grapetree/grapetree-tutorial-1.html "GrapeTree tutorial").
* The advantages of GrapeTree comparing with other rectangular visulation tool (ITOL e.g.) are:
	* Classification for large structure within massive data at a glance(literally).
	* Fully interactive.

However, such characteristics have brought some problems, for example:
For some very close nodes, sometimes there will be inevitable and obvious overlap. Although I will describe some methods to avoid overlap below, for people who do not know GrapeTree or EnteroBase, it may cause some confusion in understanding the topological structure of the phylogeny.
